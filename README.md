##Title
Grocery budget planner


##Background

The problem with comparing food budgets is that no two are exactly alike. Naturally, some people spend more (or less) based on their family size, preferences and income. That’s why it’s important to find the grocery budget that’s right

##Description 
Grocery budget planner app. This start-up app idea is for helping people who do grocery on regular basis. But they don’t have an understanding of how much they actually consume and spend on groceries. The app will allow users to feed data about their purchases daily/weekly/monthly. Then the system would give them analytics that would help them in future budget allocation.
